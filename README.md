# RandomUIs: A Diverse Collection of User Interface Designs

## 🎨 Overview
**Short and Simple:** Random UIs from wide ranging domains like machine learning, deep learning, crytpography, image processing etc.

## ✨ Features & Highlights

Clean Code: Bare bone non-bloated scripts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Not implemented (future todo's)**: At the moment, just download the neccessay libraries in scripts. I have all libraries on latest versions and not encountered any conflicts.
